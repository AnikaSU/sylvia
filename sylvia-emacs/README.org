#+TITLE: sylvia-mode

[[./basic-usage.gif]]

=sylvia-mode= for Emacs is an environment for working with text with a focus on pronunciation and sound, such as when composing song lyrics or slam poetry. Powered by the Sylvia python package, it facilitates word-finding via phoneme patterns using an elaborate regular expression format. The major-mode also provides various contextual hints during editing.

Feature Highlights:
- *Phoneme Regex Queries*
  - Free-form entry of Sylvia-format phonetic regular expressions.
  - Matching words are offered to user, and selection is pushed onto the =kill-ring=.
  - Optionally, field is prefilled with the phonemes for the word-at-point, or words-in-region.
- *Rhyming Words*
  - List words which rhyme with word-at-point, or words-in-region.
  - Matching words are offered to user, and selection is pushed onto the =kill-ring=.
- *Interactive Rhyming Regex Creation*
  - Generates a phonetic regular expression from the word-at-point, or words-in-region, which would strictly match "rhyming" words.
  - Support for different "rhyme-levels" of various strictness (loose, default, and perfect).
  - The regular expression may be edited by the user before the query is executed.
- *Phonemes at Point* displayed in Echo Area
- *Syllable Counts* in window margin.
- Infers the pronunciation of words which are not present in the CMU dictionary.
- Sorts results for all functions by word popularity using Google's N-Gram dataset.

* Installation

To use =sylvia-mode=, you just need to install the =sylvia= Python package and the =sylvia= emacs package.

As described in the [[../README.org][Sylvia package README]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip2 install sylvia
#+END_SRC

The emacs component is not yet in MELPA. To install, download =sylvia.el= somewhere in your =load-path=, and then install the dependencies in emacs;

#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x package-install <return> epc <return>
M-x package-install <return> dash <return>
#+END_SRC

* Usage

** Installation
Require the Sylvia package in your Emacs init file (after placing =sylvia.el= in your =load-path=);

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'sylvia)
#+END_SRC

Then, open a new buffer or text file and type =M-x sylvia-mode=.

** Exposed End-User Functions
*** sylvia:copy-regex-query-result-as-kill

This command allows you to:
- Enter a free-form phonetic regex query.
- After hitting =<return>=, all known matching words will be listed via =completing-read=
- The selected result is pushed onto the =kill-ring=.

Check the [[../README.org][Sylvia Python package README]] for more complete documentation on the phonetic regex format.

*** sylvia:copy-rhyme-as-kill

Without prefix argument, this command lists all rhyming words for the word-at-point, or words-in-region, using the "default" rhyme-level.

With prefix argument, it will:
- Prompt for a rhyme-level (loose, default, or perfect) via =completing-read=
- Generate a phonetic regex which satisfies that rhyme-level using word-at-point, or words-in-region
- Allow free-form editing of the regex, then finally, upon =<return>=...
- List matching words of that regex via =completing-read=
- The selected result is pushed onto the =kill-ring=.

* Contributing

=sylvia-mode= is developed in =sylvia.org=. Please make all changes there, and then tangle-them to =sylvia.el= via =org-babel-tangle-file=.

This software is roughly early beta quality, and anyone interested in contributed is very welcome to do so!

Known Issues:
- Syllable overlays are sometimes thrown into the wrong window?
- Realtime query like counsel-ag, swyper, etc would be much, much, much nicer
- Delta updates to the Sylvia server would be more efficient
- Non-ASCII characters in the buffer will break everything. Sylvia is going to be converted to Python3 to fix this.

Feature Ideas:
- Display phonemes in echo area as unicode IPA symbols (ɱ, ɮ, ɠ, etc), rather than CMU's ASCII friendly format.
- Assonance, consonance, alliteration, etc as new rhyming strategies (alongside perfect and default -- loose is technically assonance already)
- Sound classes analogous to [[https://www.regular-expressions.info/posixbrackets.html][posix regex character classes]], like =[:plosive:]=, =[:nasal:]=, =[:fricative:]=, etc. This, in particular, could give 'better' default rhymes.
- Syntax-highlighting for regions in current stanza which syllabically correspond to word-at-point
- Sub-word selection of phonemes via-region, using a char-to-phoneme alignment engine

Ideas from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/bk1hdz/sylviael_rhyming_engine_phonetic_regular/][Reddit]]:
- When rhyming interactively, find a way to intelligently suggest previous/recent/corresponding words such that the user does not need to navigate manually to the word.
- The lexical-lets are superfluous, as the *.el file is now using lexical binding file-wide.
